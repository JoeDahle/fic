# TBELL F.I.C

TBELL FIC is an attempt leveraging the voice of the masses in persuading Taco Bell to give fried ice cream a try. It's also a project for myself to help solidify my understanding of React, React Router and all that that entails.

# Note to Everyone!
This is a public PSA, if you have a twitter, facebook, anything! mention [this](tbellfic.herokuapp.com) website to Taco Bell. Use the #WeWantFriedIceCream and let's spread the word to everyone! Fried Ice Cream at TBell would be a huge dream come true! Not only that, buuutt, it would be a worthy successor to the Chocotaco. I whole-heartedly believe that if anyone can bring us the fried ice cream, it's TBell, even if it's as short lived as the Naked Chicken Chalupa, Quesalupa and other items. Give it a shot!

# Second Note
I'm just an average Joe, I don't work for Taco Bell, never have. If I did, I really wouldn't need this site to get the word to corporate, would I? Or maaayyyybe I would? Who knows, I've never worked in the food industry, I did work at a grocery store once. Anywho, just go and spread the word, visit the site and let's get fried ice cream nation wide, yo.
